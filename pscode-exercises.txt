// Exercise 1: Calculate the Sum of Two Numbers

a + b = c

num1 + num2 = sum
print sum

ask for 2 numbers 
add the 2 number together 
print on the screen the sum of those 2 numbers


// Exercise 2: Check if a Number is Even or Odd

ask for a number
divide the number by two (use modulus)
if remainder = 0 then number is Even
else number is odd


// Exercise 3: 
Write pseudo code that will perform the following.    

a) Read in 5 separate numbers.   
b) Calculate the average of the five numbers.
c) Find the smallest (minimum) and largest (maximum) of the five entered numbers.
d) Write out the results found from steps b and c with a message describing what they are

ask for 5 numbers
create three variables; sum, minimum, maximum
loop over the 5 numbers, calling the iteration value x
-each iteration, add x to sum
-compare x to minumum and store the smaller value as minimum
-compare x to maximum and store the larger value as maximum
print to the screen:
-the value of sum / 5 with the description of "average"
-the value of minimum with the description of "minimum"
-the value of maximum with the description of "maximum"
